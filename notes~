django notes:

signals are a bitch
the entire view class is loaded into the server when it is used - globals work
syncdb will not drop and reup a table that changes implementation if you don't change the name (at least sometimes) - operational error or something
'login' for some reason means something in the view - so watch out, its not django.contrib.auths.views.login
