<p>Bandocalypse is going to be a web application and IOS app to track what your favorite bands are doing! album drops and concerts near you will appear in a timeline, searchable forwards and backwards, and by singular band. Currently we are a work in progress; limited profiling is set up to allow a proof-of-concept data pull from the last.fm API using an extension of the pylast library. the next iteration should bring out much more usability, and the one after that will be focused on user interface and look and feel.</p>
