<p>Bandocalypse is going to be a web application and IOS app to track what your favorite bands are doing! album drops and concerts near you will appear in a timeline, searchable forwards and backwards, and by singular band. Currently we are a work in progress; limited profiling is set up to allow a proof-of-concept data pull from the last.fm API using an extension of the pylast library.

<br/><br/> all patterns provided by <a href = "http://www.dinpattern.com/">http://www.dinpattern.com/</a>, who do great work</p>
